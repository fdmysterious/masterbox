Master Box
==========

Master Box is a simple game in which you have to solve mathematicals enigmas
with the numbers on the board. Be smart !

It started as a school project, in so-called "Informatique et Sciences du Num√©rique" lesson, commonly abbrigged ISN,
which is about learning to code some little programs, this year in javascript.

But we were already knowing how to program in javascript, so we wanted to go a little further.
So began this project.
